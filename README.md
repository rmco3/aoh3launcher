# What is AOH3 Launcher and what does it do?
AOH3 Launcher allows you to download and play Age of History 3 for free, wow! After downloading the game, you can play it directly without downloading it again or experiencing any problems! ðŸ˜± It increases the performance you will get in the game with some settings! (very little, but still cool...)

Currently only English language is supported. New languages â€‹â€‹may be added in the future, always keep the application updated for developments. Unless I'm lazy.

AOH3 Launcher will continue to receive new updates for a long time (I hope so), I am still planning to develop the app and release new updates. If you have an idea, or found a bug in the app, take a look at the Issues page of AOH3 Launcher. If you want, you can also use this link directly:
